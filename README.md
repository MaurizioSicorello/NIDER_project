# NIDER_project
 Data and analyses for a collaborative meta-analysis on the Neurobiology of Individual Differences in Emotion Regulation.


# Reproducibility Notes
This project uses Matlab and R. All analysis scripts can be found in the "scripts" folder. Matlab analyses require downloading the SPM toolbox and the CanlabCore Toolbox. Further, the "functions" folder of this repository
has to be on the path for custom function. Packages for R analyses are tracked with the renv package. Open the "NIDER_project.Rproj" file on the top level. Then, install the "renv" package and use "renv::restore()". Then, open and use the R scripts from within this Rstudio environment.
